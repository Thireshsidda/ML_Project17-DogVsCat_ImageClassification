# ML_Project17-DogVsCat_ImageClassification

### Dog vs Cat Image Classification with Transfer Learning
This project demonstrates image classification for distinguishing between dogs and cats using transfer learning with VGG16. The model is trained on a dataset of dog and cat images and achieves high accuracy.

### Getting Started

#### Requirements: 
Ensure you have TensorFlow, Keras, and other necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip install tensorflow keras.

#### Data Preparation:
Prepare a dataset of dog and cat images organized into two subdirectories named "cats" and "dogs" within a training set directory.
Similarly, organize another directory for test images.

#### Code Breakdown:
##### Model Creation:
The code utilizes the pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction.

VGG16 weights are loaded with include_top=False to exclude the final classification layers.

Existing weights in VGG16 are frozen to prevent retraining them.

A new Flatten layer is added to convert the 3D output from VGG16 to a 1D vector.

A final dense layer with one unit and sigmoid activation is added for binary classification (dog or cat).

The entire model is compiled with a binary cross-entropy loss function, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric.

#### Data Augmentation:

ImageDataGenerator is used for data augmentation techniques like rescaling, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping applied only to the training data. This helps the model generalize better on unseen images.

Separate ImageDataGenerator instances are created for training and test sets with appropriate rescaling and class mode settings.

The flow_from_directory method is used to generate batches of images and labels from the directories.

#### Training:

The model is trained for a specified number of epochs using the fit method.

Training and validation losses and accuracies are monitored during training and displayed in each epoch.

#### Visualization (Optional):

A function show is provided to visualize a batch of images with their corresponding labels (ground truth or predicted). You can use this to inspect training data and model predictions.

#### Running the Script:

Modify the file paths (train_path and test_path) in the code to point to your dataset directories.

Execute the script (e.g., python dog_vs_cat.py). The script performs training and displays training progress.

### Further Exploration:

Experiment with different hyperparameters like the number of epochs, learning rate, data augmentation techniques, and optimizer settings to potentially improve model performance.

Early stopping can be implemented to stop training if validation loss doesn't improve for a certain number of epochs.

Evaluate the model performance on a separate unseen test set for a more robust evaluation.

Explore other pre-trained models like ResNet50 or InceptionV3 for comparison.

Visualize the filters learned in the convolutional layers to understand what features the model focuses on for classification.

This project provides a foundation for using transfer learning for image classification tasks. By leveraging pre-trained models, you can achieve good results even with limited training data.
